            <p id="p-1">Formed in North Carolina in 2006, Future Islands is a modern synth-pop band featuring Samuel Herring, Gerrit Welmers, William Cashion, and Michael Lowery.</p>
            <p>Singer Samuel Herring describes their music as "Where the songs have always been kind of upbeat and happy, the message is often melancholy. I like it that way, people's natural instinct is to let their guards down and dance, and then they actually let the words seep in. Instead of turning away from the darkness, they embrace the light and find the darkness. I think the opposite is true too."</p>
